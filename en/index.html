			<h1 class="bottom-border-blue">About Alis</h1>

			<div>
				<h2>On A Strong Foundation</h2>
				<p>Alis LGX is based on Arch Linux.<br>
				Arch is a reasonably popular distro due to its simplicity of structure, freshness of software and its unmatched robustness, and Alis matches most of these characteristics.<br></p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Extensive Softwares</h2>
				<p>Alis borrows many software packages from Arch's repository, but software not listed there can be introduced from the Alis' repository.<br>
				In addition, the Chaotic AUR repository, where pre-built AUR packages are placed, is enabled as standard, reducing the need to build AUR packages on your own.
				Furthermore, the graphical software centres 'Discover' (LXQt, Plasma) and 'GNOME Software' (Xfce, GNOME) are included as standard. There is no need to go through the hassle of command operations to install softwares.<br></p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Optimisation That You Could Cringe</h2>
				<p>Alis' standard kernel is Linux Realtime, which has been optimised to be preemptive and low-latency through special patches.<br>
				Furthermore, the desktop environment, which is known to be heavy, has been lightened by adjusting the daemons that start up. Once you use this, you may never go back to the OS used so far.<br></p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Easy Installation</h2>
				<p>Arch comes with a text-based installer, but it is difficult for beginners to operate.<br>
				Alis has a 'Calamares' installer. Time zones can be selected on a map, the keyboard layout is detailed, and fixed drive partitioning is easy with mouse and keyboard.<br></p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Semi-permanent Use</h2>
				<p>Alis is a rolling release. There are no major updates every few months or years.<br>
				The OS only needs to be installed once, and there is no need to download the ISO again for updates!<br></p>
